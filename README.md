## Description
* Course notes, assignments, and presentation slides for major disciplines (divided into science and technology) during undergraduate studies
    * List the「main content」such as「course notes & PowerPoint」in the「Courses directory」separately
    * While「detailed information」such as「homework, ppt attachments」are placed in the「subdirectory」of「corresponding serial numbers」
* The file arrangement in the「Total_Grades folder」, also follows「the same rules」as the three「Courses folder」
    * 「Important content」is placed as「files」in the「primary directory」
    * The「detailed information」of「the file」is placed in the form of「a folder」in the「secondary directory」with「the same serial number」as「the file」

## Inplementation
1. Powerpoint includes videos
    * To play the videos of a PPT, go to the corresponding「subdirectory」of「Presentations」to view the PPT
2. Academic grades/performance/achievements includes「slices over time」or「sections of time evolution」
    * To view relevant files, enter the「subfolder」of the「Total_Grades folder」

## History
* This repo 👉 [undergraduate courses](https://github.com/ChenZhu-Xie/undergraduate_courses) was built
