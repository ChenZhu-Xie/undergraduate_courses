# Static webpages (Crack password :point_right: log in Xanadu)

## About
* This project 👉 [offline web_pages](https://github.com/ChenZhu-Xie/1A2B_3C_4A5B) is a series of static personal webpages I created at the age of 16.

## Description
* Computer course assignment during high school.
* Old technology stack: **FrontPage**.
    * Limited to the time and technology at that time, the effect may be unsatisfactory
    * But in terms of ideas, there are bi-directional links, puzzle solving/decryption, modifying game files, space exploration, hand-picked background music, etc. All of this constitutes the exploration, shouting, and wandering of that personal period.

## Inplementation
1. Enter homepage from "Homepage (My Mini Website Portal). lnk".  
2. Explore freely :point_right: until you decrypt the password :point_right: and unlock the hidden webpages.
    * Solve the riddle! Or you'll be stuck here: in the middle of nowhere forever!
3. PS: Due to its age (2014_05), page music may not be playable,  
    * and the background image size cannot adapt to the browser window size.

    * (Personal time) by 16-year-old little Xie
